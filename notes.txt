Stop sliding  //done

- else {rb2d.velocity = new Vector2(0,rb2d.velocity.y);}  //worked

- I was using Input.GetAxis() instead of Input.GetAxisRaw()

-In the rigid body.
Play around with its mass (try increasing it).
Try increasing its linear dampening (which is called drag I think).

Give it a physics materiel.

For the physics material
Sets its static and dynamic material to 1.0
Also set the friction combine parameter to use maximum.

-Change the following settings in your projects physics settings.

Edit > Project Settings > Physics

Solver Iteration Count: at least 10 (I use 15)
Enable Adaptive Force: On (I turn this on, although it isn't necessary)

Player stuck on wall

- Platform Effector 2D  //worked

- Apply a "slippery" physics material to the character's box collider.

i.e, Assets > Create > PhysicsMaterial2D and simply changed the friction variable to 0 from the inspector and apply to walls as well as character.

- With this method, he still stuck to walls for me. I fixed it by changing the Friction & Bounce Combine settings from "Average" to "Multiply" with the Dynamic & Static Friction set to 0.

- https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PhysicsMaterial2D.html

- Dont necessarily need to add bounciness, did you try to reduce the friction to near 0?
If it does not work, maybe you need to add this material to the character too... (Ive never tried this in 2d, so sorry if this does not work - it solved the same issue for me in 3d).
