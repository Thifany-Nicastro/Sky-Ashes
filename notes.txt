Stop sliding

- else {rb2d.velocity = new Vector2(0,rb2d.velocity.y);}

- I was using Input.GetAxis() instead of Input.GetAxisRaw()

-In the rigid body.
Play around with its mass (try increasing it).
Try increasing its linear dampening (which is called drag I think).

Give it a physics materiel.

For the physics material
Sets its static and dynamic material to 1.0
Also set the friction combine parameter to use maximum.

-Change the following settings in your projects physics settings.

Edit > Project Settings > Physics

Solver Iteration Count: at least 10 (I use 15)
Enable Adaptive Force: On (I turn this on, although it isn't necessary)
